/* The deck, as a state machine.
 *
 * Three cards, face-down, in a shuffled order. What a tier buys is how many of
 * them you may turn over — never how many you may read, because a card you
 * turned over stays readable forever at every tier.
 *
 * The backs go up the moment the set opens, before the cards are written: a
 * back is label and subtitle only, so it needs nothing from the writer. That is
 * what makes the flip the latency budget rather than a spinner — turn one over
 * early and it holds on its mid-flip edge until the words land.
 *
 * Shared by the live surface and the design page so both walk the identical
 * machine, and there is only one place where "spent" is defined. */
