/* The flip.
 *
 * The whole card is the hit target, and the animation is the latency budget:
 * the card is being written while it turns. It is deliberately not short —
 * nobody notices 450ms, everybody notices a weak card — and it never becomes a
 * spinner, a skeleton or a percentage. If the writer runs past the turn, the
 * card holds on its mid-flip edge with a quiet pulse until the fallback lands.
 *
 * Mechanically it is a half-turn out, a swap at the edge, and a half-turn back
 * in, which is why the phases below are `out` → `edge` → `in` rather than a
 * single rotation: swapping the content at the halfway point is what makes the
 * two faces read as two sides of one card. */
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'
